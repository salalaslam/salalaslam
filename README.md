ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Salal. Iâ€™ve been building software for 13+ years, and I still get a kick out of solving problems end to end.
	â€¢	On the frontend, I build fast React/Next.js apps that donâ€™t just look good â€” they perform.
	â€¢	On the backend, I write NestJS/Node.js services that play nicely with Postgres and donâ€™t crumble under scale. Iâ€™ve spent enough time in query plans to know when to fix an N+1 issue, add the right index, or dive into EXPLAIN ANALYZE to squeeze out real performance.
	â€¢	Iâ€™m comfortable with the full DevOps loop â€” GitHub Actions, GHCR, AWS EC2/S3 â€” so my code doesnâ€™t just run locally, it runs reliably in production.

Debugging? Thatâ€™s my sport. Whether itâ€™s frontend, backend, or infra, I dig until I find the root cause. Telemetry and observability are my go-tos, not afterthoughts.

I care about writing clean, maintainable code: TypeScript everywhere, ESLint/Prettier/Stylelint always on, unit tests included. Performance profiling (Lighthouse, React Profiler, bundle analysis) is just part of the workflow.

Iâ€™ve built and scaled SaaS applications, mentored teams, and recently spent a lot of time showing devs how to get more done with AI-assisted coding tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, Gemini). Theyâ€™re not replacements â€” theyâ€™re multipliers.

If you need someone who can design, build, debug, and ship quickly â€” while helping your team level up â€” letâ€™s talk.
